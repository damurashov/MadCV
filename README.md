# About

I am embedded software developer with the primary domain of interest and
expertise comprising bare-metal and RTOS-based firmware development.

Leaving particular technologies aside, I've been doing the very job most
embedded software developers do, that being developing, debugging, and
maintaining firmware, bringing up MCUs, porting software, debugging hardware
using testing equipment such as logic analyzers, multimeters, and scopes,
soldering (that includes SMD), working with schematics. I also possess some
skills in application development, which enables me to test some pieces of
functionality (such as connectivity) right on the bench.

I speak fluently, so conducting an interview in English would not be an issue.

Please do not hestate to contact me.
